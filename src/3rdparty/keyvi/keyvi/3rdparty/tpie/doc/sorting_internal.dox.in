/**
\page sorting_internal Internal sorting

Internal memory sorting is implemented in \ref parallel_sort.h as a parallel
quick sort with a sequential partition step. The implementation uses the TPIE
job manager, implemented in \ref job.h and job.cpp.

Like std::sort, the input to parallel sorting is given as two forward
iterators, \c begin and \c end. It is then up to the implementation to spawn as
many quick sort jobs as needed. If the input is sufficiently small,
\c std::sort is used directly. Otherwise, the input is repeatedly partitioned
(using a sequential partition), and a new job is spawned on the smaller half of
the result from the partition. When the job size is sufficiently small,
\c std::sort is used.

Example \c sorting.cpp:

\code
@DOCCODE_SORTING_INTERNAL@
\endcode

Place in your \c tpie project folder, and on Linux, compile with:
\code
$ g++ -I. -Ibuild -c sorting.cpp -Wall -Wextra -O3
$ g++ sorting.o -o sorting build/tpie/libtpie.a -lboost_date_time-mt -lboost_thread-mt -lboost_filesystem-mt -lboost_system-mt 
\endcode
