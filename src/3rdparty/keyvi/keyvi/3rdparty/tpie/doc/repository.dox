\section sec_overview Repository overview

The library source code mainly resides in the \c tpie/ directory. See \ref files.

The \c test/ directory contains test code. \c test/unit/ contains source code for
unit tests used by CTest, and \c test/speed_regression/ contains programs for
measuring TPIE performance.

The \c cpp0xtest/ directory contains code that might not compile on all modern
compilers. CMake uses this to determine if the system compiler supports
variadic templates and rvalues.

The \c example/ directory contains a simple example of how to use TPIE
in your application, this includes a small CMakeLists.txt example.
