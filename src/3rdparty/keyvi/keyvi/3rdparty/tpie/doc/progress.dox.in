/**
\page progress Progress reporting

TPIE has a couple classes for reporting progress to the user. The central
concept is the progress_indicator, fleshed out in
\ref tpie::progress_indicator_base. A progress indicator must have the methods
init(stream_size_type steps), step() and done(). It should inherit from the
virtual base class \ref tpie::progress_indicator_base.

The simplest way of reporting progress is settling on a concrete progress
indicator, for instance \ref tpie::progress_indicator_arrow, and passing around
pointers or references to this in your code. You may then call init() once with
the number of items to process and step() for each item and finally done() when
you have completed processing. The following piece of code is from the file
\c example/helloworld.cpp (albeit slightly modified).

\section fractional Fractional progress reporting

Often, you will divide your algorithm into several sequential steps. In this
case, you may choose to have more than one progress indicator. If you wish to
display just a single progress bar showing the total progress towards the goal,
TPIE provides a fractional progress indicator implementation.

A fractional progress indicator wraps another progress indicator and provides
as many fractional subindicators as the user needs. A fractional subindicator
adheres to the progress indicator concept. Behind the scenes, the fractional
progress indicator measures the time it takes each step of the algorithm to
complete. Using the execution time predictor, over several runs of the
algorithm it will become better at predicting the amount of time each
subindicator spends. In the simplest case, a program will first write items to
a stream, and then read them back. Using a fractional progress indicator, TPIE
will eventually figure out the ratio of time spent between reading and writing.
Eventually, the amount of progress reported to the user will increase linearly
with wall clock time.

The following example is taken from the file \c example/helloworld.cpp.

\section dummyprogress Disabling progress reporting

There are two ways in which you may optionally disable progress reporting at
runtime.

The first is polymorphically. If you pass around pointers to the
progress_indicator_base class, you may instantiate
tpie::progress_indicator_null rather than, say, tpie::progress_indicator_arrow.
This is a virtual null object implementation of the progress indicator base
class. Although no progress is reported, you still pay the price of a virtual
method call for each call to step().

The second is using templates. TPIE provides a light-weight null object
implementation of the progress indicator \b concept called
tpie::dummy_progress_indicator. This, in conjunction with the
tpie::progress_types helper class and a boolean template parameter indicating
whether to report progress or not, allows you to generate two versions of code
at compile time: One with progress enabled, and one without.

\code
@DOCCODE_PROGRESS3@
\endcode

Since dummy_progress_indicator has non-virtual, inline implementations of the
init, step and done methods, we save a lot of CPU work at run time when the
user wishes to disable progress reporting. However, twice the amount of code is
generated, which may lead to more frequent cache misses, which can incur
performance penalty at run time.
