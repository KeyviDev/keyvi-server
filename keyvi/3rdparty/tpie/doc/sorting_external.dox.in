/**
\page sorting_external External sorting

The recommended way to sort large data set (which will typically be
stored in a \ref tpie::file_stream in TPIE) is to use one of the \ref
tpie::sort functions defined in \ref sort.h.

When you have a \ref tpie::file_stream over some type \c T (opened for
reading and writing), you can order the elements of this stream
according to the order defined by the \c < operator (i.e. using \c
T::operator< or \c operator<(T,T) ) simply invoke \ref tpie::sort
(mystream, mystream). When the input and output stream is the same,
the temporary space usage of \ref tpie::sort is the same as the space
used by the input stream.

If you wish to store the result in a stream different from the input
stream, supply this stream as the second argument to \r tpie::sort,
this requires extra space equivalent to twice the space used by the
input stream.

The current interface is
defined in the \c tpie namespace, but legacy definitions exist in the
\c tpie::ami namespace.
