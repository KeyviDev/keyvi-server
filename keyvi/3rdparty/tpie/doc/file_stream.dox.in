/**
\page file_stream Reading and writing file streams

The central class in TPIE for reading from files and writing to files is the
file_stream class. It reads and writes primitives and primitive structures to
files.

\code
@DOCCODE_FILE_STREAM@
\endcode

The main methods of interest are \ref tpie::file_stream::open(),
\ref tpie::file_stream::close(), \ref tpie::file_stream::read(),
\ref tpie::file_stream::write(), \ref tpie::file_stream::seek().

By default, \ref tpie::file_stream reads and writes blocks of size 2 MB at a
time. You can change this by passing a block factor to the constructor of
file_stream.
