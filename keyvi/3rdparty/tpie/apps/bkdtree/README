This project consists of three programs for building multi-dimensional point data 
structures and one program for generating random multi-dimensional
points. Details about command line options  can be obtained by running a
program without options.

build_bkdtree 

	Build a bkd-tree from a given set of points, either by repeated
	insertions using the logarithmic method, or by bulk loading. There
	are three different bulk loading methods: binary (classic), grid,
	and sample.

	Once built or read from disk, the bkd-tree can be queried with
	rectangular ranges.

build_kdbtree

	Build a K-D-B-tree from a given set of points, either by repeated
	insertions, or by transforming a bulk loaded kd-tree.

        Once built or read from disk, the bkd-tree can be queried with
        rectangular ranges.

build_btree

	Build a B+-tree from a given set of points, either by repeated
	insertion using the logarithmic method, or by bulk loading.

	Once built or read from disk, the bkd-tree can be queried with
        rectangular ranges.

datagen

	Generate a stream of multi-dimensional points, either random, or
	from a given ASCII file.
